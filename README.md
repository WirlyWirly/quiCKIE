# **🐰 quiCKIE 🐰**

This UserScript will generate **BunnyButtons 🐰** alongside the sites regular download buttons. When clicked, the corresponding torrent will be sent to [qui](https://getqui.com/) using your custom settings.

There is currently support for **20+** different trackers. I will **NOT** be adding anymore private trackers, as I have already included all the ones I have access to. If a tracker you use isn't on the list, I have written a small guide on how you may easily contribute so that it can be added: [The 3 Steps to Adding a New Tracker to quiCKIE](https://gist.github.com/WirlyWirly/1ffd87e5a3d3f7ce206860d8c100df88?permalink_comment_id=5974494#gistcomment-5974494)

This UserScript is similar to the official [qui browser add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/qui/), except we're creating a BunnyButton on the page itself, thus making it more convenient and even accessible on mobile devices.

The quiCKIE settings panel is registered to the menu of your UserScript Manager, which is the dialogue on your toolbar that lists the currently active UserScripts. Only the **quiURL** and **ApiKey** are required, everything else is optional. Hover over the column headers for more info about how each field can be filled in.
